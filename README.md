# Python Crash Course - Programs, Exercises, and Solutions

This repository contains programs, exercises, and solutions
for Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. I used Python and 
Vim on a Fedora 37 system in a VirtualBox to create, use, 
and manage directories and files as I work through Matthes'
Python Crash Course book.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions
or comments. In addition, feel free to utilize the programs,
exercises, and solutions for your consumption and edification.
